## 🔐 Security Notes

**Signing Key Protection:**
```
✅ generate release.jks locally
✅ Encode to base64
✅ Add to GitHub Secrets (encrypted)
✅ NEVER commit release.jks to git
✅ NEVER share publicly
✅ NEVER push plaintext passwords

.gitignore prevents accidental commits:
- *.jks (keystore files)
- *.p12 (certificates)
- .env files
```

**GitHub Access Control:**
```
✅ Private repository (only invited users)
✅ GitHub Secrets encrypted (GitHub manages)
✅ APK links private if private repo
✅ Can optionally share release links
```

   - Keep GitHub secrets safe
   - Document in secure location

4. **Track versions**
   - Use semantic versioning (v1.0.0)
   - Tag releases on GitHub
   - Keep changelog updated

5. **Monitor builds**
